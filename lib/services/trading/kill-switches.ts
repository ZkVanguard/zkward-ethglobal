/**
 * Pure kill-switch evaluator for the polymarket-edge-trader.
 *
 * Three independent trip conditions:
 *   1. Consecutive losses ≥ MAX_CONSECUTIVE_LOSSES
 *   2. Drawdown from peak ≥ MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT — but only when the peak
 *      is "meaningful" (see PEAK_FLOOR rationale below). Prevents the
 *      $0.10-win-then-$0.10-loss = "100% drawdown" false trip observed
 *      2026-07-13.
 *   3. Daily realized PnL ≤ DAILY_LOSS_CAP_USD
 *
 * Any one trips → halt for HALT_DURATION_MS. The route uses this
 * decision to write cron_state + notify Discord; this module has no
 * side effects so all 6 branches are unit-testable.
