/**
 * Profit-Lock Guard — protects gains by capping risk exposure during
 * drawdowns from ATH.
 *
 * ## Problem
 *
 * The two-legged strategy (spot LONG + perp SHORT hedge) is designed to
 * be delta-neutral at 100% hedge ratio. But at small NAV, BlueFin's
 * per-symbol minQty prevents perp hedges on assets whose target notional
 * falls below the minimum:
 *
 *   BTC-PERP minQty 0.001 → $60 notional min (at $60k spot)
 *   ETH-PERP minQty 0.01  → $16 notional min (at $1600 spot)
 *   SUI-PERP minQty 1     → $0.72 notional min
 *
 * At $54 NAV, only SUI can be reliably hedged. The rest is naked spot
 * exposure — when markets pull back, the pool bleeds spot losses while
 * the small hedges can't offset them.
 *
 * ## Fix
 *
 * When NAV drops below rolling peak by more than `PROFIT_LOCK_DRAWDOWN_PCT`,
 * cap the risk allocation. The higher the drawdown, the more we shift
 * into USDC (which doesn't move). This DOES sacrifice upside during a
 * recovery — the cost of insurance is missing part of the bounce — but
 * prevents the profit from bleeding away in a slow chop.
 *
 * ## Behavior
 *
 * | Drawdown from ATH | Max risk allocation |
 * |-------------------|---------------------|
 * | < 5%              | 100% (no clamp)     |
 * | 5-10%             | 80%                 |
 * | 10-15%            | 60%                 |
 * | 15-20%            | 40%                 |
 * | ≥ 20%             | 0% (all USDC)       |
 *
 * The tiers scale inversely with drawdown. Env override:
 *   PROFIT_LOCK_DISABLE=1              — turn off entirely
 *   PROFIT_LOCK_DRAWDOWN_START=5       — start clamping at this drawdown %
 *   PROFIT_LOCK_ZERO_RISK_AT=20        — go 100% USDC at this drawdown %
 *
 * ## Interaction with existing hedgeability clamp
 *
 * The existing "hedgeability clamp" (sui-community-pool line 1422) drops
 * assets that can't be hedged at current NAV. This guard runs BEFORE
 * that — it caps total risk allocation first, then the hedgeability clamp
 * redistributes what's left. If profit-lock reduces risk to 40% and
 * hedgeability then drops BTC, the remaining risk goes to ETH/SUI.

/**
 * Derive the effective peak NAV from on-chain ATH share price × current shares,
 * capped at the rolling-window peak from pool-nav-monitor.
 *
 * Historically this fixed the peak-NAV deadlock (2026-08-11) where a monotonic
 * cron_state peak trapped the pool after a drawdown: deposits raised NAV but
 * not the peak, so drawdown stayed halted. Deriving from `athSharePrice ×
 * currentShares` was intended to scale the peak with deposits.
 *
 * But the derivation is anachronistic when `athSharePrice` was recorded with
 * a much smaller `totalShares` than today: multiplying today's share count by
 * a boot-phase share-price high produces a peak the current cohort never
 * actually held at. Observed 2026-08-14: on-chain ATH share price $2.32 (set
 * with ~10 shares in pool bootstrap) × current 74 shares = $171.76 phantom
 * peak → 67% "drawdown" from a NAV the pool never reached → autohedge halted.
 *
 * Rolling peak from pool-nav-monitor (`poolNav:peak:<pool>`) already handles
 * the deposit case correctly — its 7-day window advances organically when a
 * deposit lifts NAV. Cap derived at rolling peak so anachronism can't inflate
 * the halt gate. Only use raw derived value when rolling peak is missing
 * (fresh pool, cron never ran) — bootstrap-only fallback.
